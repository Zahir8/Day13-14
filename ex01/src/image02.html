            <h1>Weight Lifting</h1>
            <p>Olympic weightlifting, or Olympic-style weightlifting, often simply referred to as
            weightlifting, is a sport in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of
            a barbell loaded with weight plates.<br><br>The two competition lifts in order are the snatch
            and the clean and jerk. The snatch is a wide-grip, one-move lift. The clean and jerk is a
            close-grip, two-move lift. Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each, and the
            combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a
            bodyweight category. Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors
            and change over time. A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one
            successful clean and jerk also fails to total, and therefore receives an "incomplete" entry
            for the competition. The clean and press was once a competition lift, but was discontinued
            due to difficulties in judging proper form.<br><br>In comparison with other strength sports,
            which test limit strength (with or without lifting aids), weightlifting tests aspects of
            human ballistic limits (explosive strength); the lifts are therefore executed faster—and with
            more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution—than other strength
            movements.</p>
